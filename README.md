# Resume

Zhang Hai's resume in Markdown.

Online Version: http://resume.zhanghai.me

This project is forked from [Zeno Zeng's resume](https://github.com/zenozeng/resume), based on [xuxiaodong's resume theme](https://github.com/xuxiaodong/resume). An additional gh-pages deployer script is added by me for convenience.

## Install

```bash
sudo apt-get install wkhtmltopdf
npm install
```

## Build

```bash
./build.sh
```

## Deploy

Configure remote in `deploy.sh` first.

```bash
./deploy.sh
```
